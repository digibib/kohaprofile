=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script uses a git repo and a Koha instance running off that Git repo. It 
will step x commits back in time, run some tests/benchmarks against the 
insallation, step one commit forward in time, run the tests again, step forward, 
run the tests an so on, until it reaches the most recent commit. 

Several iterations of the tests can be done per commit, and the times measured
for each iteration will be averaged. 

Output is done as an HTML file, which shows a table of the average times for 
each commit and test. The oldest commit is shown at the top and the newest 
commit is at the bottom. 

The idea here is to see how performance changes over time, and spot both 
negative and positie trends, as well as any commits that lead to dramatic 
changes in performance. 

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The configuration is stored in a YAML file, see that default-config.yaml that
accompanies this script for an example.
